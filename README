Indent is a small tool to reindent lines and trim space in source code files.
The following transformations are performed (on each line):

  * right spaces stripped
  * leading tabs converted to spaces (configurable, default: 1 tab -> 2 spaces)
  * indent of an empty line adjusted to match either the preceding of the following nonempty line
    (according to some common sense rules)

Each file is rewritten in place. Any errors will be printed, and file not updated.
Files over 1Mb are skipped. 

Usage:
  > indent [options] filename filename2 ...

Options:
  -d      debug info, file not overwritten, result written to file.indent
  -t num  tab converted to num spaces
